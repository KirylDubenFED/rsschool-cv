I have wanted to enter the world of development for a long time, but there was always not enough time due to my family commitments. I always had desire to work in IT industry (after leaving school I worked part-time in an educational establishment as PC operator).
My friends and colleagues know me as the go-to person for all computer related problems: from fixing internet, testing and installing the correct applications to resolving problems with reinstalling OS.
I am quick to assimilate new ideas and I am willing to undertake further training to develop new skills. I thrive under pressure and challenging working environments.

I try constantly to learn something new to improve my web and programming skills through reading articles and work with private tutor. 
In my free time I also enjoy activities which relate to IT such as designing new apps and watching videos related coding.
My favorite book is learn.javascript.ru.
